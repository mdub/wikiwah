  # Subst handles text-transformation using a series of regular-expression
  # substitutions.  It encapsulates a number of "patterns", and associated
  # blocks.  Each block is invoked with a MatchData object when it's
  # associated pattern matches, and is expected to return a replacement
  # string.
  #
  # The difference between using Subst and applying a series of gsub's is
  # that replacement values are protected from subsequent transformations.
